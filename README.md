## Installation
This application uses the NodeJS runtime environment. Make sure you have this installed. This is also using MongoDB for the database. Please install on your workstation before running.
1. Clone the repo on your localhost or remote server.

2. Navigate into the server folder using Terminal

3. Edit the .env.template file to add your MongoDB URI and rename this to .env  
If running locally, it should look like the below:
`MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost/[your_db_name]`

4. Run the commands:
- *npm install*
- *npm start*

The server should now be running (by default on port 3001).
